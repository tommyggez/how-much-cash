# how-much-cash
*work in progress*

The goal of this project is to optimise the amount of cash needed in a business's cash register, to have a low probability of running out of change, while minimising wasted net working capital

At its current stage, we are able to calculate the probability of running out of cash, given expected sales of various items, and the starting amount of cash.
